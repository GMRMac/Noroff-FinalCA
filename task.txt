Styling

You will need to restyle this application. Please use a CSS Pre-processor of your choice but ensure that your styles are in accordance with BEM standards. The colors of the entire website should change and you should use design principles which you have learnt thus far. You will be marked on this.

Login Page

You will be required to create a login; this login will save a username and password to your local storage. It should have a form field for a username and password and a submit button. If the username is incorrect, please display an error message like we did throughout this course. If the password is incorrect, please display an error message. If the password and username is correct direct them to the home page.

Homepage

Once you have logged in successfully, you will be redirected to the homepage of this application. You will need to make an API call to: https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards. If you have issues, use the conversion URLS, which you saw in the Vue.js and Angular modules.

On the home page there is functionality which allows the user to search. Please ensure that this search works.
If the view more button is clicked, you need to be taken to a specific page for that card. Remember to pass the ID in as a parameter in the URL.The framework which you chose should handle this for you.


About Page

Please create a contact form. The name and last name textboxes shouldnâ€™t be empty. The email textbox should have a valid email address inside it. The number format should be as follows

Display error messages for each of the fields, if there are any errors on them. If the value of that textbox is valid, hide the error message. All this should happen after a user clicks the submit button.
